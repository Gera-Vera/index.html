  <h1>My Life As A Soccer Player</h1>
  
  <p>I'm Gerardo Tapia Vera, and I'm born and raised on the soccer fields of Salinas, California. I'm 30 years old now, and I'm a high school graduate from Alisal High School
    and a university graduate from the University of San Francisco. I earned my high school diploma in June 2010, and I earned my Bachelor's of Arts degree in December 2014. I
    played varsity soccer all 4 years at Alisal, and I became a starter my sophemore year as the right midfielder. I became captain my Junior year. We won the league all 4 years
    I was there including 
    a CCS championship my senior year, a 1-0 win versus our biggest playoffs rival Watsonville High School at Gilroy High School's stadium. I played some time for the varsity 
    team at the University of San Francisco, but I never became a starter on the team. Fortunately, I also played club soccer and intramural soccer where I was a starter as a 
    center midfilder. I earned a 3.7 
    G.P.A. in high school, and my favorite subject was Math. The highest Math class I took in High School was Algebra 2, and I got an A in the class. I earned a 2.8 G.P.A. at 
    the University of San Francisco, and my favorite course was Human Physiology. I accumilated an A grade in my Human Physiology class as well. As you can see, I have a 
    passion for soccer and education, but I've also made some not so smart moves in the working world. I've worked 
    various jobs, but I now solely dedicate my time to learning programming languages and reading non-fiction books. I say I work as a Freelance Front End Web Designer and 
    Python programmer, but I've yet to do any coding for a client. Online, I see that companies are looking to hire junior programmers and are willing to train the individual, 
    and I've applied to those jobs. However, I haven't been hired by any of them. I don't get contacted, because they're false job postings. Therefore, I have to be dogmatic,
    disciplined, and hopeful that my company will flourish. I expect this website and what I do make an impact on the people that see it. I do desire that my company makes an 
    impact all over the world by allowing children to understand that sports and school are very important
    responsibilities in life that lead to the wellbeing and success of any individual. Please feel free to contact me at my cellphone number 8313561442 or my email 
    gerardov66@gmail.com, thank you.</p>
