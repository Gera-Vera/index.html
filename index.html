<h1 style="border-style: outset; border-color: white blue white red; border-radius: 5px;">I'm Gerardo Tapia Vera</h1>
<p style="border-style: outset; border-color: white blue white red; border-radius: 5px;">I'm Gerardo Tapia Vera, and I'm born and raised in Salinas, California. I was a student-athlete since I was in middle school, and I was even a student-athlete in college
  playing Soccer. My favorite subject in school was Math, and I played as an offensive player throughout my career. I loved eating with friends during lunch time, and it was 
  slightly different in college do to everyone having courses throughout the different times in the day. I now invest my time in eating healthy, walking, cooking, cleaning, 
  listening to music, watching movies, and coding. I hope to one day become a full-stack web developer with lots of Data Science experince as well. My goals include to promote
  healthy eating and exercise along with mental health for a mind, body, and soul transformation.</p>

  <p>I began playing soccer at the age of 5 years old, and I became very passionate about it. I devoted so many years to it, and I played competitively until I was 28
    years old before I began suffering ankle and muscle injuries. I stopped playing for 2 years, and I'm now 30 years old getting fit to play once again. It'll be my hard work 
    and discipline that'll get me to becoming a fit and creative player again. I've always been a fit and intelligent player, and I think it's time to become more creative. I've
    been captain of most of the teams I've played in, and I've led by example not so much by verbal communication. Therefore, it's time to lead verbally and by example in the 
    upcoming soccer years of my career. I'm not playing in a professional league, but I'll be playing here in a local league where a soccer player
    of my caliber to succeed once again is very possible. I hope to be recognized locally once again as the league champion with the new team that I'll be joining along with my 
    older cousin. I'll be playing as an offensive player, and I hope to become an essential playmaker in this team as well that scores lots of goals. I want to be the main 
    assist and goal scorer in the team, my point is, to be the playmaker and win games for the team that will ultimately lead us to outscoring opponents and winning my first 
    championship with this team.</p>
  
  <p>I've got to let you know that I used to weigh 141 pounds when I was at my prime at the University of San Francisco from 2010 through 2014, and I used to run 5 miles
    under 32 minutes along with 2 miles in under 11 minutes and 30 seconds. My favorite exercise personal record is the push ups one, because I was able to do 92 of them in a 
    single minute, the most out of everyone at the end of that semester. I'm still very proud of that achievement, but my sit ups personal record was shattered by the others. Also,
    my back squat personal record was amongst the best of my teammates at the end of that semester, but I don't remember how much I lifted. I was a very strong player, but my stature
    and speed didn't help me much at the Division 1 level amongst other Elite Soccer players from around the world. Anyways, that was 7 years ago, and I've gained so much weight.
    I've gone up to weight up to 213 pounds because of the medication and lack of energy I had to exercise. I began taking medication for Schizophrenia, and I'll always keep in
    the people that changed on me mentally and socially to set me up to end up in the mental health unit. I'll never forgive them for that. Anyways, lately, I've been walking for 
    at least one hour daily to lose weight, and I've managed to do so. I've even seen the change in my physique, and I'll weigh myself tonight once the weigh machine becomes
    available to me. I believe I weigh in the high 170s and low 180s, and I've also been doing sets of sit ups and push ups. I'll slowly add more body weight exercises to my daily
    rountine. At the moment, I gotta make sure I workout enough but not force it too much to the point that I get injured, and I have to keep stretching all of my muscle groups
    along with eating healthy with plenty of water.</p>
  
  <p>I'd also love to share with the internet community that I've worked jobs in various job industries. I've worked in the restaurant industry, in the grocery store industry, in the
    clothing store industry, in the general labor industry, and I've also worked for the City Council here in Salinas, California. My favorite job was at the Bon Appetit Cafeteria 
    at the University of San Francisco where I prepared Pizza, other foods that were Italian, and Salad. Also, I worked at the Pastry Station where I sold coffees and served 
    pastries to mainly students of the university, staff, professors, and visitors. Also, I worked at the Bevergae and Sancks station along with the Latino station where I served
    Chicken, Beans, Rice, Cheese, and Lettuce Burritos or Tacos to everyone. I was also the cashier at times. Besidies working for Bon Appetit, I worked for Safeway. I worked there
    as a Courtesy Clerk that made rounds around the store every 15 minutes to clean the store, including the restrooms. I also had to assist shoppers, put perishables back to their
    designated locations as soon as possible, bag groceries, carry groceries to the shopper's vehicle, and collect shopping carts. I forgot to mention that I worked for the U.S.F.
    Men's Soccer team as a Dribbling Coach where I thought children to dribble the soccer ball along with some juking moves, and I also got to work for the Women's Soccer team as
    an Assistant Trainer where I healed girls of their injuries. After that, I worked for the University's Fitness Gymnasium that at that time was called Koret Center. There, I
    made rounds every 15 minutes to clean the machines and interact with the members to make sure they had any of their questions answered and were using the machines correctly.
    I graduated in December 2014 with a Bachelor's of Arts in Exercise and Sports Science, and I was able to acquire a 2.8 GPA. I wanted to complete a Bachelor's of Science, but I
    failed my Chemistry 2 class twice. Therfore, I had to settle for a Bachelor's of Arts and focus on graduating instead of playing another semester of Soccer under head coach
    Eddie Soto. Eddie was more of an offensive coach and preferred creativity. That's why I enjoyed playing for him more. I immediately thought about graduating and getting home 
    to help my family financially, so I decided to work a General Labor job at True Leaf Farms in San Juan Bautista as a Broccoli dumper. I worked there Full-Time, and I even worked 
    12 hour shifts at times. During those days, I used to drive a 1993 Honda Accord to work for a total of 1 hour 6 days a week. It's still in my memory that I'd even forget some of
    my equipment at home, and I had to borrow some of the equipment at work from the people that handed out equipment to new employees. There was a few times that I did return home
    to get the equipment, and thus, I was late to work. I never got fired though, they saw that I worked well in that position and they needed that position to be filled. I used
    to dump tons of broccoli daily, and I did from April 2015 to November 2015. I was getting paid for heavy labor, and at that time, it was $10.72. Most of my paychecks were of 
    about $550 weekly, and I was offered the opportunity to go work in Arizona during that Winter. I decided to take a break and stay in Salinas, California with my family. My family
    is who I was working for, and I wasn't just working for myself. Anyways, I went to work there again in April of 2016, but the whole environment was changed. There was more
    machines, and there was less people working. I didn't like it, and also, I got injured at work. I had the worker that pushed in the pallets with the car hit my foot, and I
    screamed out loud. My coorkers heard me, and they were able to get all of the broccoli off my body and pallets out of the way. They also carried me out of the cooler into the 
    owner's office to see how my foot was doing. All I asked for was ice for my foot, and I was ready to work again the next day. I decided to stop working there after poor supervision.
    I returned to work there again the next year, 2017, but I was surrounded by poor supervision again. I was out of work for a couple of months before I was diagnosed with
    Schizophrenia, Anxiety, and Depression. I was misdiagnosed, for I never even spoke to a doctor. I guess he just dignosed that based on my blood work. I had to take the medication
    before I exited the Mental Health unit and returned to my home, and I was even given medication that damaged my muscle cells that severely stiffened my muscles to the point
    that I couldn't get into or out of bed. Also, I couldn't urinate. I was hospitalized for this, and I was taken off all of my medications except for one. I was still given the one
    for Schizophrenia, and I have my physical prowess and fitness has decreased ever since. I am thankful for being able to work for Building Healthy Communities here in Salinas,
    California where I assisted community members in accessing benefits. For exmaple, monetary benefits to pay for food or rent with proof of need required. Also, I helped people
    in making their appointments for the COVID-19 vaccine. This job was during the first quarter of 2021, and I haven't had a job ever since. I just got interviewed to work for 
    Subway Restaurants yesterday, and I did fine. I think I'll be called for a second interview or to get hired, and if I don't, then I'll give them a call.</p>
  
  <h1>December 18th, 2021</h1>
  <p>Today's been a recovery day for me, because I did cardio for about an hour yesterday. My body was very tired today, and I couldn't jog. I could only walk, and I walked for 
    about 20 minutes in the daylight before I walked into my home again to hydrate and sleep. My body was so sore. I've made sure to healthy foods today and hydrate, and I think
    I'll also skip doing my sit ups and push ups today. I believe Saturday will be my rest day before the games on Sundays. My game for tomorrow was cancelled, but we were told
    that friendly matches will occur next weekend. I'll make sure to be prepared to play at least an hour at the next game. This is all I have to write for tonight, and I'll
  go back to reading my e-book.</p>
  
  <h1>December 21st, 2021</h1>
  <p>I thought that I'd be able to write in my diary daily, but I was incorrect. It's not a very big deal, as nothing much has changed. My body is fine now though, and I'll 
    jog tomorrow afternoon with God's blessings. At the moment, I'm here listening to YouTube music, especifically J. Balvin. He's such a great artist, and I've already loved
    this genre. If you don't listen to him, then I suggest you do. If you're yet to learn any Spanish and you love dancing, then he's a great artist to listen to. He's an artist
    I listen to daily now. He's a Latin singer, and he also has songs with American artists. I also want to let everyone know that I did get a call from Interim Inc. this morning,
    and they told be that they're ready to talk to me about my skills and experience to find job opportunities for myself. I'll have that conversation with them until Tuesday 
    January 4th, 2022 at 10am. I scheduled it to be a phone meeting, but maybe I'll change it to be an in person meeting to see the woman that will be interviewing me. Some of these
    women are beautiful and fine, so maybe this one will be too. It's an opportunity for me to find a job and a girlfriend, and I'm taking it without thinking about it anymore.
    I'm calling them tomorrow morning to change the meeting to an in person one. Tell me what ya'll think about that.</p>
  
  <h1>December 28th, 2021</h1>
  <p>Wow, this past week has been a real thrill for me. Lots of fun here at home with family members. We ate festive Mexican food and drank lots of alcohol. Everyone is safe
    and back at work, but the party will soon commence for New York. I'll post some photos and videos on my Tik Tok and Instagram accounts. I hope ya'll see them, like them, and
    comment on them. Live your life everyone, and keep your friends and family closer than ever this coming new year. Always add value to your family.</p>
  
  <h1>December 29th, 2021</h1>
  <p>Hello everyone, I've got to say that I'm so excited for this coming year. I hope to get a job by the end of January with an assembling company here in Salinas, California.
    I submitted my application over a week ago now, and I was told that I'd be contacted after the new year. I' told them that I'm only looking for a part-time job, but I would 
    also love to work-full time. I took a wood shop class in high school, so I know that I will enjoy that job. Also, I want to let you know that I'm signed up for a soccer
    team this winter season, and I was contacted by the coach today saying that there will be no game this weekend do to the New Year and field conditions. We are going to get
    together next weekend though onto the soccer field to have a practice session. That's what the text message said, but I don't know if it'll actually come true. I hope it does.
