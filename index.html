<h1>I'm Gerardo Tapia Vera</h1>
<p>I'm Gerardo Tapia Vera, and I'm born and raised in Salinas, California. I was a student-athlete since I was in middle school, and I was even a student-athlete in college
  playing Soccer. My favorite subject in school was Math, and I played as an offensive player throughout my career. I loved eating with friends during lunch time, and it was 
  slightly different in college do to everyone having courses throughout the different times in the day. I now invest my time in eating healthy, walking, cooking, cleaning, 
  listening to music, watching movies, and coding. I hope to one day become a full-stack web developer with lots of Data Science experince as well. My goals include to promote
  healthy eating and exercise along with mental health for a mind, body, and soul transformation.</p>
