<h1 style="border-style: outset; border-color: white blue white red; border-radius: 5px;">I'm Gerardo Tapia Vera</h1>
<p style="border-style: outset; border-color: white blue white red; border-radius: 5px;">I'm Gerardo Tapia Vera, and I'm born and raised in Salinas, California. I was a student-athlete since I was in middle school, and I was even a student-athlete in college
  playing Soccer. My favorite subject in school was Math, and I played as an offensive player throughout my career. I loved eating with friends during lunch time, and it was 
  slightly different in college do to everyone having courses throughout the different times in the day. I now invest my time in eating healthy, walking, cooking, cleaning, 
  listening to music, watching movies, and coding. I hope to one day become a full-stack web developer with lots of Data Science experince as well. My goals include to promote
  healthy eating and exercise along with mental health for a mind, body, and soul transformation.</p>

  <p>I began playing soccer at the age of 5 years old, and I became very passionate about it. I devoted so many years to it, and I played competitively until I was 28
    years old before I began suffering ankle and muscle injuries. I stopped playing for 2 years, and I'm now 30 years old getting fit to play once again. It'll be my hard work 
    and discipline that'll get me to becoming a fit and creative player again. I've always been a fit and intelligent player, and I think it's time to become more creative. I've
    been captain of most of the teams I've played in, and I've led by example not so much by verbal communication. Therefore, it's time to lead verbally and by example in the 
    upcoming soccer years of my career. I'm not playing in a professional league, but I'll be playing here in a local league where a soccer player
    of my caliber to succeed once again is very possible. I hope to be recognized locally once again as the league champion with the new team that I'll be joining along with my 
    older cousin. I'll be playing as an offensive player, and I hope to become an essential playmaker in this team as well that scores lots of goals. I want to be the main 
    assist and goal scorer in the team, my point is, to be the playmaker and win games for the team that will ultimately lead us to outscoring opponents and winning my first 
    championship with this team.</p>
