<h1>Can We Meet For Some Coffee?</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Gerardo Tapia Vera. I'm 30 years old, and I'm searching for online friends that I can eventually meet in person here in Salinas, California. I'm looking to make new
  friends, because my old friends don't seem to chat with me too much anymore. I need new friends to add them as job references for future jobs that I'll be appplying to.
  I'm a skilled individual, but sometimes references are a requirement of a job application. I'm available to meet any day for some coffee and a pastry at any local coffee
  shop, and I can go ahead and buy the first time we meet. I like both hot and cold coffee, and I also like all kinds of pastries. You can contact me at my email 
  gerardov66@gmail.com, or you can contact me at my cellphone number 8313561442. I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
  
  <p>I'll tell you more about myself. I enjoy reading non-fiction books on the history of computers, the history of American espionage, and Biotechnology. I also enjoy coding
    websites and Python programs. I like going for walks inside my neighborhood, I enjoy listening to music, and I love watching my favorite soccer teams on tv. I'm hard working,
    I'm a fast learner, I'm respectful, I'm punctual, I'm personable, I'm loyal, and I'm trustworthy. I like meeting all kinds of people, but I mostly admire those who are
    athletes and those who are in the military. Thanks for reading this far, I hope I intrigued you enough to contact me in order for us to meet in person.</p>
