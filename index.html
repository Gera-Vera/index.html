<div id="hone"><h1>Can We Meet For Some Coffee?</h1></div>

<div><p>Hi, I'm Gerardo Tapia Vera. I'm 30 years old, and I'm searching for online friends that I can eventually meet in person here in Salinas, California. I'm looking to make new
  friends that enjoy reading non-fiction books, that enjoy writing complete sentences, that enjoy walking, and that enjoy listening to music of all kinds. I need new friends to 
  add them as job references for future jobs that I'll be appplying to. I'm a skilled individual, but sometimes references are a requirement of a job application. I'm available to 
  meet any day for some coffee and a pastry at any local coffee shop, and I can go ahead and buy the first time we meet. I like both hot and cold coffee, and I also like all kinds
  of pastries. You can contact me at my email gerardov66@gmail.com, or you can contact me at my cellphone number 8313561442. I hope to hear from you soon.</p><p>I'll tell you more about myself. I enjoy reading non-fiction books on the history of computers, the history of American espionage, and Biotechnology. I also enjoy coding
    websites and Python programs. I like going for walks inside my neighborhood, I enjoy listening to reggaeton music, and I love watching my favorite soccer teams on tv. I'm hard
    working, I'm a fast learner, I'm respectful, I'm punctual, I'm personable, I'm loyal, and I'm trustworthy. I like meeting all kinds of people, and I mostly admire those who are
    athletes and those who are in the military. Thanks for reading this far, I hope I intrigued you enough to contact me in order for us to meet in person.</p></div>
