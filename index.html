<div id="hone"><h1>Can We Meet For Some Coffee?</h1></div>

<div>
  
  <p>Hi, I'm Gerardo Tapia Vera. I'm 30 years old, and I'm a freelance frontend web designer and Python programmer for WBAMN. I aspire to make a website for everyone,
  especially athletes that have played or played soccer. I was a soccer player myself playing club soccer and at the middle school, high school, and university level. I'm a 
  division 1 CCS soccer champion with Alisal, and I'm a former division 1 NCAA soccer player at the University of San Francisco where I studied Kinesiology. I graduated in 
  December 2014 from my university, and I immediately returned to Salinas, California to help my family financially. I enjoy reading non-fiction books, writing 
  complete sentences, walking, and listening to music of all kinds. I need new friends to add them as job references for future jobs that I'll be appplying to. I'm a skilled 
  individual, but sometimes references are a requirement of a job application. I'm available to meet any day for some coffee and a pastry at any local coffee shop, and I can go 
  ahead and buy the first time we meet. I like both hot and cold coffee, and I also like all kinds of pastries. You can contact me at my email gerardov66@gmail.com, or you can 
  contact me at my cellphone number 8313561442. I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
  
  <p>I'll tell you more about myself. I enjoy reading non-fiction books on the history of computers, the history of American espionage, and Biotechnology. I also enjoy coding
    websites and Python programs. I like going for walks inside my neighborhood, I enjoy listening to reggaeton music, and I love watching my favorite soccer teams on tv. I'm 
    hard working, I'm a fast learner, I'm respectful, I'm punctual, I'm personable, I'm loyal, and I'm trustworthy. I like meeting all kinds of people, and I mostly admire those
    who are athletes and those who are in the military. Thanks for reading this far, I hope I intrigued you enough to contact me in order for us to meet in person.</p></div>
