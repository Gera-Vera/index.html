<h1 style="border-style: outset; border-color: white blue white red; border-radius: 5px;">I'm Gerardo Tapia Vera</h1>
<p style="border-style: outset; border-color: white blue white red; border-radius: 5px;">I'm Gerardo Tapia Vera, and I'm born and raised in Salinas, California. I was a student-athlete since I was in middle school, and I was even a student-athlete in college
  playing Soccer. My favorite subject in school was Math, and I played as an offensive player throughout my career. I loved eating with friends during lunch time, and it was 
  slightly different in college do to everyone having courses throughout the different times in the day. I now invest my time in eating healthy, walking, cooking, cleaning, 
  listening to music, watching movies, and coding. I hope to one day become a full-stack web developer with lots of Data Science experince as well. My goals include to promote
  healthy eating and exercise along with mental health for a mind, body, and soul transformation.</p>

  <p>I began playing soccer at the age of 5 years old, and I became very passionate about it. I devoted so many years to it, and I played competitively until I was 28
    years old before I began suffering ankle and muscle injuries. I stopped playing for 2 years, and I'm now 30 years old getting fit to play once again. It'll be my hard work 
    and discipline that'll get me to becoming a fit and creative player again. I've always been a fit and intelligent player, and I think it's time to become more creative. I've
    been captain of most of the teams I've played in, and I've led by example not so much by verbal communication. Therefore, it's time to lead verbally and by example in the 
    upcoming soccer years of my career. I'm not playing in a professional league, but I'll be playing here in a local league where a soccer player
    of my caliber to succeed once again is very possible. I hope to be recognized locally once again as the league champion with the new team that I'll be joining along with my 
    older cousin. I'll be playing as an offensive player, and I hope to become an essential playmaker in this team as well that scores lots of goals. I want to be the main 
    assist and goal scorer in the team, my point is, to be the playmaker and win games for the team that will ultimately lead us to outscoring opponents and winning my first 
    championship with this team.</p>
  
  <p>I've got to let you know that I used to weigh 141 pounds when I was at my prime at the University of San Francisco from 2010 through 2014, and I used to run 5 miles
    under 32 minutes along with 2 miles in under 11 minutes and 30 seconds. My favorite exercise personal record is the push ups one, because I was able to do 92 of them in a 
    single minute, the most out of everyone at the end of that semester. I'm still very proud of that achievement, but my sit ups personal record was shattered by the others. Also,
    my back squat personal record was amongst the best of my teammates at the end of that semester, but I don't remember how much I lifted. I was a very strong player, but my stature
    and speed didn't help me much at the Division 1 level amongst other Elite Soccer players from around the world. Anyways, that was 7 years ago, and I've gained so much weight.
    I've gone up to weight up to 213 pounds because of the medication and lack of energy I had to exercise. I began taking medication for Schizophrenia, and I'll always keep in
    the people that changed on me mentally and socially to set me up to end up in the mental health unit. I'll never forgive them for that. Anyways, lately, I've been walking for 
    at least one hour daily to lose weight, and I've managed to do so. I've even seen the change in my physique, and I'll weigh myself tonight once the weigh machine becomes
    available to me. I believe I weigh in the high 170s and low 180s, and I've also been doing sets of sit ups and push ups. I'll slowly add more body weight exercises to my daily
    rountine. At the moment, I gotta make sure I workout enough but not force it too much to the point that I get injured, and I have to keep stretching all of my muscle groups
    along with eating healthy with plenty of water.</p>
  
  <p>I'd also love to share with the internet community that I've worked jobs in various job industries. I've worked in the restaurant industry, in the grocery store industry, in the
    clothing store industry, in the general labor industry, and I've also worked for the City Council here in Salinas, California. My favorite job was at the Bon Appetit Cafeteria 
    at the University of San Francisco where I prepared Pizza, other foods that were Italian, and Salad. Also, I worked at the Pastry Station where I sold coffees and served 
    pastries to mainly students of the university, staff, professors, and visitors. Also, I worked at the Bevergae and Sancks station along with the Latino station where I served
    Chicken, Beans, Rice, Cheese, and Lettuce Burritos or Tacos to everyone. I was also the cashier at times. Besidies working for Bon Appetit, I worked for Safeway. I worked there
    as a Courtesy Clerk that made rounds around the store every 15 minutes to clean the store, including the restrooms. I also had to assist shoppers, put perishables back to their
    designated locations as soon as possible, bag groceries, carry groceries to the shopper's vehicle, and collect shopping carts. I forgot to mention that I worked for the U.S.F.
    Men's Soccer team as a Dribbling Coach where I thought children to dribble the soccer ball along with some juking moves, and I also got to work for the Women's Soccer team as
    an Assistant Trainer where I healed girls of their injuries. After that, I worked for the University's Fitness Gymnasium that at that time was called Koret Center. There, I
    made rounds every 15 minutes to clean the machines and interact with the members to make sure they had any of their questions answered and were using the machines correctly.
    I graduated in December 2014 with a Bachelor's of Arts in Exercise and Sports Science, and I was able to acquire a 2.8 GPA. I wanted to complete a Bachelor's of Science, but I
    failed my Chemistry 2 class twice. Therfore, I had to settle for a Bachelor's of Arts and focus on graduating instead of playing another semester of Soccer under head coach
    Eddie Soto. Eddie was more of an offensive coach and preferred creativity. That's why I enjoyed playing for him more. I immediately thought about graduating and getting home 
    to help my family financially, so I decided to work a General Labor job at True Leaf Farms in San Juan Bautista as a Broccoli dumper. I worked there Full-Time, and I even worked 
    12 hour shifts at times. During those days, I used to drive a 1993 Honda Accord to work for a total of 1 hour 6 days a week. It's still in my memory that I'd even forget some of
    my equipment at home, and I had to borrow some of the equipment at work from the people that handed out equipment to new employees. There was a few times that I did return home
    to get the equipment, and thus, I was late to work. I never got fired though, they saw that I worked well in that position and they needed that position to be filled. I used
    to dump tons of broccoli daily, and I did from April 2015 to November 2015. I was getting paid for heavy labor, and at that time, it was $10.72. Most of my paychecks were of 
    about $550 weekly, and I was offered the opportunity to go work in Arizona during that Winter. I decided to take a break and stay in Salinas, California with my family. My family
    is who I was working for, and I wasn't just working for myself. Anyways, I went to work there again in April of 2016, but the whole environment was changed. There was more
    machines, and there was less people working. I didn't like it, and also, I got injured at work. I had the worker that pushed in the pallets with the car hit my foot, and I
    screamed out loud. My coorkers heard me, and they were able to get all of the broccoli off my body and pallets out of the way. They also carried me out of the cooler into the 
    owner's office to see how my foot was doing. All I asked for was ice for my foot, and I was ready to work again the next day. I decided to stop working there after poor supervision.
    I returned to work there again the next year, 2017, but I was surrounded by poor supervision again. I was out of work for a couple of months before I was diagnosed with
    Schizophrenia, Anxiety, and Depression. I was misdiagnosed, for I never even spoke to a doctor. I guess he just dignosed that based on my blood work. I had to take the medication
    before I exited the Mental Health unit and returned to my home, and I was even given medication that damaged my muscle cells that severely stiffened my muscles to the point
    that I couldn't get into or out of bed. Also, I couldn't urinate. I was hospitalized for this, and I was taken off all of my medications except for one. I was still given the one
    for Schizophrenia, and I have my physical prowess and fitness has decreased ever since. I am thankful for being able to work for Building Healthy Communities here in Salinas,
    California where I assisted community members in accessing benefits. For exmaple, monetary benefits to pay for food or rent with proof of need required. Also, I helped people
    in making their appointments for the COVID-19 vaccine. This job was during the first quarter of 2021, and I haven't had a job ever since. I just got interviewed to work for 
    Subway Restaurants yesterday, and I did fine. I think I'll be called for a second interview or to get hired, and if I don't, then I'll give them a call.</p>
  
  <h1>December 18th, 2021</h1>
  <p>Today's been a recovery day for me, because I did cardio for about an hour yesterday. My body was very tired today, and I couldn't jog. I could only walk, and I walked for 
    about 20 minutes in the daylight before I walked into my home again to hydrate and sleep. My body was so sore. I've made sure to healthy foods today and hydrate, and I think
    I'll also skip doing my sit ups and push ups today. I believe Saturday will be my rest day before the games on Sundays. My game for tomorrow was cancelled, but we were told
    that friendly matches will occur next weekend. I'll make sure to be prepared to play at least an hour at the next game. This is all I have to write for tonight, and I'll
  go back to reading my e-book.</p>
  
  <h1>December 21st, 2021</h1>
  <p>I thought that I'd be able to write in my diary daily, but I was incorrect. It's not a very big deal, as nothing much has changed. My body is fine now though, and I'll 
    jog tomorrow afternoon with God's blessings. At the moment, I'm here listening to YouTube music, especifically J. Balvin. He's such a great artist, and I've already loved
    this genre. If you don't listen to him, then I suggest you do. If you're yet to learn any Spanish and you love dancing, then he's a great artist to listen to. He's an artist
    I listen to daily now. He's a Latin singer, and he also has songs with American artists. I also want to let everyone know that I did get a call from Interim Inc. this morning,
    and they told be that they're ready to talk to me about my skills and experience to find job opportunities for myself. I'll have that conversation with them until Tuesday 
    January 4th, 2022 at 10am. I scheduled it to be a phone meeting, but maybe I'll change it to be an in person meeting to see the woman that will be interviewing me. Some of these
    women are beautiful and fine, so maybe this one will be too. It's an opportunity for me to find a job and a girlfriend, and I'm taking it without thinking about it anymore.
    I'm calling them tomorrow morning to change the meeting to an in person one. Tell me what ya'll think about that.</p>
  
  <h1>December 28th, 2021</h1>
  <p>Wow, this past week has been a real thrill for me. Lots of fun here at home with family members. We ate festive Mexican food and drank lots of alcohol. Everyone is safe
    and back at work, but the party will soon commence for New York. I'll post some photos and videos on my Tik Tok and Instagram accounts. I hope ya'll see them, like them, and
    comment on them. Live your life everyone, and keep your friends and family closer than ever this coming new year. Always add value to your family.</p>
  
  <h1>December 29th, 2021</h1>
  <p>Hello everyone, I've got to say that I'm so excited for this coming year. I hope to get a job by the end of January with an assembling company here in Salinas, California.
    I submitted my application over a week ago now, and I was told that I'd be contacted after the new year. I' told them that I'm only looking for a part-time job, but I would 
    also love to work-full time. I took a wood shop class in high school, so I know that I will enjoy that job. Also, I want to let you know that I'm signed up for a soccer
    team this winter season, and I was contacted by the coach today saying that there will be no game this weekend do to the New Year and field conditions. We are going to get
    together next weekend though onto the soccer field to have a practice session. That's what the text message said, but I don't know if it'll actually come true. I hope it
    doesn't, because I honestly believe I made an error in registering for the team. I shouldn't be playing soccer anymore due to my health condition. My mind, body, and soul are
    just not in a healthy condition to play soccer. I'll give it a shot though, I won't give up on my health. I'll keep fighting, and the important thing is to also make sure my
    days are happy ones.
  </p>
  
  <h1>December 30th, 2021</h1>
  <p>Today I wanna chat about how I was working a job with Building Healthy Communities that allowed me to get my COVID shots. I'm so thankful for had worked that job for that
    reason, and I've got to tell you that the shots didn't hurt at all. They're the smoothest shots I've ever gotten. However, I did get my Flu shot this season, and that one
    slightly hurts. Anyways, the next day, it was my COVID booster shot shoulder that was sore and my Flu shot shoulder was fine. Talking about COVID, it's incredible how the 
    cases have increased dramatically. I don't know what America is going to do with all of these US Citizens that become infected, maybe it is a sing that immigrants will take 
    over the the United States and build a new country. I hope we can all become unified and learn to harness our powers, so that we can become a type 1 civilization and conquer
    outer space sometime. Hopefully within the next generation, but we're gonna have to work extremely hard for that to happen. I hope my writing inspires others to do well in
    school, especially the young children. Like I was told when I was a boy, I'll tell them too that they are the future of our family and thus the human race. I need people to
    feel happy while working, and I need them to feel accomplished at the end of the school day or work day.</p>
  
  <h1>January 5th, 2022</h1>
  <p>This past week has been a lazy one for me, for I have been sleeping about 12 hours every day. I've been sleeping at about 2 in the morning and waking up at 2 in the afternoon.
    I have been communicating with people in Instagram though, but nothing very serious because they're all people who can't get into a voice or video call with me. It's difficult
    to know for sure who I'm having a conversation with. I still go ahead and share some advice and photos of myself with them, because that's my duty as an individual. My job's to
    make the world a better place for future generations to live in. A lot of people do pretend to love you though, and they are only here for money. They claim that they don't have
    a job, they claim that they don't have food, and they claim that they don't have much time on their cell phone plan. Sometimes they say that their phones are broken. Whatever
    the reason is, I'm not going to send them any money and allow them to scam me. I'm only searching for a girlfriend who I can voice call and video call with, but that has been
    impossible until now. I've yet to find a girl through social media that lives in Salinas and is ready to date a man like myself. I have to stop worrying about that, because that's
    obviously not working. I need to focus on just getting a new job, so I need to keep collaborating with the city to be placed in one. Until next time.</p>
  
  <h1>January 7th, 2022</h1>
  <p>So, I got the phone call from the SEES program worker from Interim here in Salinas, California this morning at 10 in the morning, and it was a very basic and casual
    converstion with the worker. I exchnaged some of my personal details with the worker along with what I wanted to accomplish within the program, and I was told about what the 
    program could do for me. I found out that the program still works very much the same as it used to a few years ago when I had first applied to the program, and I was never
    called in return from my first in person meeting. Maybe they though that I could do it on my own, and I do think that I can get a job on my own at times. However, we all know
    that we do not live alone in this world, and we always need to collaborate with others for the best creation possible to sustain a future. I told the worker I wanted a clerical
    job, and I also told the worker that I'm willing to return to school to get the required education for a job in teaching. I can maybe be a subtitute-teacher. I know that my
    former high school soccer coach encouraged me to do that a few years ago. I never saw myself as being a teacher though, and I'm slowly beginning to see that it could be one
    of the only options due to the fact that I was such a great student-athlete. Not all people are as successful as myself in school though, and many do not take school seriously.
    That's where everything can become out of control, hectic, and even dangerous to the point where something can become life threatning. Sure, I put myslef in an environment
  where I'm aiding the future of humanity by educating these students, but some students just go becuase they are required by law. Otherwise, students would be out there doing
  God knows what. We need more educated indivuduals in this city, students that go to 4 year universities and come back home to Salinas, California to live with their family 
  members and build their own here too. It's all about family first.</p>
  
  <p>Also, tonight, I want to write about the music that I'm listening to at the moment. I'm listening to the "Aim To Head" channel in YouTube, and the music is Cyberpunk and EBM.
    It's the best kind of music I have ever listened to in my entire life, and I hope that music like this continues to improve. I recently became a fan of it, and I became in love
    with it after the first song I found in YouTube. This channel's incredible, and I highly suggest it to everyone. It always makes me feel good and makes my time awake much more 
    enjoyable, and therfore, I find my time to be awake much more valuable. I become happier.</p>
  
  <p>Let's go ahead and write more about the things I know, which isn't very much, but I will do my upmost best to keep you entertained. My family raised me in Salinas, California.
    I was raised in the Acosta Plaza condominiums where a lot of immigrant families lived, and most of them worked in the fields picking strawberries throughout the whole year. It 
    was a very tiresome job, and they managed to do it for many years. My mother and father both did it, and in fact, that's where they met and fell in love with each other. I don't
    know much about how their dating evolved, but I do know that they both gave birth to 3 children togther including myslef and 2 younger sisters. They managed to stay together for
    10 years before seperating. It's said that my father was seduced by another woman, he was given a love potion, and he began loving that other woman, but I don't know the truth.
    My father tells me that he began to dislike my mother's food, and I would grow up to see what my mother really is like. I'm seeing now that they both didn't love each other very
    much, or it could be that they both didn't come from very loving families. Their parents spent most of their time working, and they also spent most of their time working here in
    the USA while we were at school. I loved going to school, and I loved playing soccer. I never saw my parents getting into any arguments at home, so it's strange to me that it was
    their attitudes towards one another that failed. I've been in one serious relationship as a teenager, but I never was married or had any children. I did have lots of sex though,
    and I did go to the same school as her. I didn't have a job, and I didn't have a weekly allowance. I was very fortunate to have a home and fed throughout those 10 years that my
    parents were together, for we used to go eat out almost every single weekend to a couple of different restaurants here in Salinas, California. We used to go out to eat to 
    Mountain Mike's Pizza on Alisal next to where there's now a CVS pharmacy and close to where the Police Department is at now. Also, we used to go out and eat at the Mexican Restaurant
    called Costa Azul on Market Street here in East Salinas as well. We always ordered Combination Pizza at Mountain Mikes, and I always ordered a Shrimp Cocktail at Costa Azul. It
    was great family time that I'll always keep in my memory, and I'll forever cherish. Slowly, but surely, we began to see my father less and less time at home, and I don't remember
    what my mother's excuse was for that. I believe she did know that my father was seeing another woman, because I believe a witchcrafter had told her. I don't know which one of the
    crafters told her, but I do have an idea of who it could've been. I've been taken to him myself multiple times, and the last time he said that there was something wrong with my
    mental health. At that time, I was working fine. I was working a full-time job, and I was making $550 checks weekly. I wasn't paying any rent here at home, but everyone here was
    very upset when I bought a $140 original La Liga Soccer ball. It was a size 5 FIFA Quality Soccer ball that's still in fine condition to this day. My family members were upset
    that I bought such an expensive Soccer ball during a time that I wasn't paying any rent. If they wanted me to pay rent, they could've just said something about it for me to pay
    rent, and I would've gladly have done it. After all, I was working for myself and the family. Everyone knows that I've never been a selfish person, and that's the reason why
    I have been a successful student-athlete in Middle School, High School, and at the University level. I've always been a team person, and that has changed drastically since I 
    bought that Soccer ball. They thought I was choosing Soccer over family, and that was totally not the case. In fact, I have also sacrifized soccer time for family time. For
    example, when I had to play Stanford at Stanford on the same day as my Mother's birthday. I chose to be here at home for her birthday instead of being on the bus with the team,
    and that was one of the most hurtful decisions I've had to make in my life. It dimished my chances of playing for U.S.F. under the offensive coaches that I preferred. It totally
    ruined the game for the team, and it ruined my last season with the team. I could've played during that game, done extremely well to the point where I'd score some goals and won
    the game for the team to set me up for a starting position for the upcoming games. My mother began crying when I was leaving for the game, and that just did it for me. I knew 
    she was hurt, but why at that moment? My older brother even said "So you care more about Soccer than you're mother?", and he knew it wasn't like that. I don't know why he made
    it seem like that, it was totally unnecessary on his part. He's been a Soccer player before, and he was supposed to have known about the sacrifice an elite soccer player has to
    make. Because of the things that have happened in my life that have set me back, I have to learn to become a more deffensive and offensive individual and trust in myself the most
    once again. I'm in control of my life, and it's totally up to me on what happens to me from here on out.</p>
